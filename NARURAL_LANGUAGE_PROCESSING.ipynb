On behalf of the Government and the people of Kenya, I \\nam delighted and deeply honoured to receive and welcome \\nH.E. Olaf Scholz, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of \\nGermany, to the Republic of Kenya.  \\n \\n2. Just over a month ago, the Chancellor warmly welcome d \\nme to Berlin on my inaugural visit to Germany as President. \\nToday, it is my great privilege to reciprocate by warmly \\nwelcoming His Excellency the Chancellor. Karibu. Vilkomen.  \\n \\n3. The rich historical ties between Kenya and Germany date \\nback to 1963 when, up on our attainment of independence, \\nGermany became the first State to recognise our newly -\\nborn nation. That marked the beginning of a deep \\nfriendship that has grown stronger every passing year. Our \\ncommon values and cooperation in diverse spheres of \\nendeavo r include energy, climate action, agriculture, \\nhealth, trade and investment, and education.  \\n \\n4. My recent visit to Berlin in March, and the Chancellor’s \\nreturn visit today, have taken place at a time when our two \\ncountries are commemorating 60 years since the  \\nestablishment of diplomatic relations.  \\n \\n5. The Chancellor and I have had fruitful discussions and we \\nhave exchanged views on the strategies and pathways \\nthrough which we can deepen the excellent relations \\nbetween our countries. I briefed the Chancellor of t he \\ngovernment’s progress in improving the business \\nenvironment, which has made Kenya significantly more \\nattractive to German investors.  \\n \\n6. I encourage the business delegation, which has \\naccompanied the Chancellor, to explore and exploit the \\nhuge untapped in vestment opportunities in Kenya.
